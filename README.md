One of the most difficult things to get used to when learning a foreign language is numbers, especially large numbers. So, I created Numprac!

Numprac is a game that I created for ESL students to practice decoding numbers quickly. As you might have guessed, Numprac is a portmanteau of the words "number" and "practice".

This is a little side project I made years ago, around 2014 or so, before I ever even decided to become a web developer, so while it might not be very pretty and the scoring system is not perfect, I'd say it's not a bad effort for just slapping stuff together!
